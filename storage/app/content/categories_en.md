Due to many options of CB, from a baton antenna through a counterpoise, a wire antenna ..... to a directional antenna on a mast, it is very difficult to strictly specify the categories. Choose the category you feel optimal for your operation.

**Infantryman** - CB hand-held (so to speak a piece of equipment that fits into your pocket, wire antennas etc., transport to the hill mostly on your own on foot)

**Mobile** - operates from a car via a mobile antenna on the car (apparently this is clear enough)

**Armoured** - a mast with antenna (solid constructions, transport by public means, cars, cable cars, electric driven vehicles ...)

**Home-based** - broadcasts from his/her home QTH

**Shared frequencies** - VHF/UHF bands for license-free use
