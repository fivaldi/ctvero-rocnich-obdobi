Each connection should contain: call sign (call sign or name), QTH - place of operation, grid locator, signal report.

There is 1 point for each connection; if the station changes its position and moves to another grid locator (further than the adjacent one), such a connection is valid too. You can also credit the connection via a repeater (1 point for all connections via one repeater). In case of operating from more places, write the "best" QTH in the report and sum up all connections.
